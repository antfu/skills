- Prefer using TypeScript over JavaScript.
- Prefer in-source testing (`if (import.meta.vitest)`) for utility functions.
- Use `vi.mock` for mocking modules.
- Prefer `describe` and `it` over `test` for better readability.
- Use `expect.soft` for non-critical assertions that shouldn't stop the test.
